# Scaling Strategy

## Performance Optimization
- **Indexing**: All high-traffic tables indexed; use of GIN/GIST for JSONB and geospatial data.
- **Partitioning**: Monthly partitioning for audit/event logs; hypertables for time-series (analytics).
- **Caching**: Redis for session, config, and hot data; MinIO for media assets.
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer for DB connections in production.

## Horizontal Scaling
- **Database**: Aurora Serverless for production; read replicas for analytics and reporting.
- **Redis**: Sentinel/Cluster mode for HA.
- **MinIO**: Multi-node distributed mode for production.

## Monitoring & Alerts
- Prometheus for DB/Redis metrics; Grafana dashboards.
- Alerting on slow queries, backup failures, and resource exhaustion.

## Future Planning
- Evaluate TimescaleDB for analytics
- Add autoscaling for ML server and object storage
