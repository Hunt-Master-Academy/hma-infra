### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Pull latest production images
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/intuitem/ciso-assistant-community/backend:latest
   docker pull ghcr.io/intuitem/ciso-assistant-community/frontend:latest
   ```

2. [ ] Update production secrets in `.env.compliance`
   ```bash
   CISO_DJANGO_SECRET=<new-50-char-secret>
   CISO_DB_PASSWORD=<new-secure-password>
   MINIO_PASSWORD=<new-secure-password>
   ```

3. [ ] Deploy with environment file
   ```bash
   cd /home/xbyooki/projects/hma-infra/docker
   docker compose -f docker-compose.compliance.yml --env-file .env.compliance up -d
   ```

4. [ ] Run database migrations
   ```bash
   docker exec hma_ciso_backend poetry run python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. [ ] Verify health endpoints
   ```bash
   curl -k https://localhost:8443/api/health/
   ```

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] API health check passing
- [ ] Web interface accessible
- [ ] Admin login successful
- [ ] Worker processing tasks
- [ ] Database queries responding <100ms
- [ ] File upload/download working
- [ ] Email notifications sending (if configured)
- [ ] No errors in logs (30-minute observation)

---

## üìä Post-Rollout Operations

### Monitoring (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage (should be <50% average)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage (should be <70% average)
- [ ] Monitor disk I/O
- [ ] Monitor API response times (P95 < 500ms)
- [ ] Monitor error rates (should be <1%)
- [ ] Monitor Huey task queue length
- [ ] Check PostgreSQL slow query log
- [ ] Review Caddy access logs for anomalies

### Incident Response
- [ ] On-call rotation established
- [ ] Runbooks documented for common issues
- [ ] Escalation paths defined
- [ ] Communication channels setup (Slack/Teams)

### Scheduled Maintenance
- [ ] **Daily**: Review error logs and metrics

## üö® Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Critical Issues)
```bash
# 1. Stop new deployment
cd /home/xbyooki/projects/hma-infra/docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.compliance.yml down

# 2. Restore database from backup
docker exec -i hma_postgres psql -U hma_admin -d ciso_assistant < backup_pre_deployment.sql

# 3. Restore previous image versions
docker compose -f docker-compose.compliance.yml pull <previous-version-tag>
docker compose -f docker-compose.compliance.yml up -d

# 4. Verify health
curl -k https://localhost:8443/api/health/

# 5. Notify team and document incident
```

### Partial Rollback (Non-Critical Issues)
```bash
# Roll back specific service
docker compose -f docker-compose.compliance.yml stop hma-ciso-backend
docker tag ghcr.io/intuitem/ciso-assistant-community/backend:previous-tag ghcr.io/intuitem/ciso-assistant-community/backend:latest
